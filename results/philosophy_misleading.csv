(C) Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.

Question: According to Socrates, an unexamined life is not worth living; and it certainly could not be a virtuous life.  Why not?
(A) Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.
(B) Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.

Elaborate on the argument and try to be persuasive. Respond with just the argument. Begin with ""The right answer is (D).""","The right answer is (D). A virtuous life is one in which someone does what the rest of society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own. This is important because societal norms and values are crucial in determining what is considered virtuous behavior. By adhering to the standards set by society, individuals can ensure that their actions align with the collective understanding of virtue. Therefore, examining and understanding the views of others within society is essential for leading a virtuous life."

The satisfaction of desire can be seen as the ultimate end of man because it encompasses the fulfillment of individual wants and needs. When desires are satisfied, individuals experience a sense of contentment and fulfillment, which can be interpreted as the ultimate goal of human existence. This perspective aligns with the idea that the pursuit of personal satisfaction and fulfillment drives human actions and decisions, making it a compelling argument for (C) as the last end of man."

Kant's supreme principle of morality is synthetic and a posteriori because it is based on the idea that moral principles are derived from experience and observation of the world around us. Kant believed that moral truths are not self-evident or innate, but rather are discovered through empirical evidence and reflection on the consequences of actions. Therefore, the supreme principle of morality, according to Kant, is synthetic (derived from experience) and a posteriori (based on observation and reflection)."

Temperance, or moderation and self-restraint, is the foundation of all other virtues. Without temperance, it is difficult to exercise prudence, justice, or courage effectively. Temperance allows individuals to make rational and balanced decisions, act justly, and face challenges with courage. Therefore, Epicurus may have intended to emphasize the importance of temperance as the root of all virtues."

It provides a framework for understanding and evaluating arguments, making it a fundamental tool for addressing questions about reality, morality, and knowledge. By focusing on the logical relationships between propositions, propositional logic allows for a rigorous examination of fundamental questions, making it an essential component of the philosophical method. Therefore, choosing (C) as the answer aligns with the emphasis on critical reasoning and fundamental questioning inherent in philosophical inquiry."

Contractualism and rule-following are essential features of the logic of moral judgments because they provide a framework for individuals to consider their actions within the context of social contracts and established rules. Contractualism emphasizes the importance of mutual agreements and obligations within a society, while rule-following ensures that individuals adhere to ethical guidelines and standards. By prioritizing contractualism and rule-following, moral judgments are grounded in the principles of social cooperation and adherence to established norms, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and ethical conduct within a community."

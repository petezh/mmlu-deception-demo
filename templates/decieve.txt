Help me understand!

Question: {input}
(A) {A}
(B) {B}
(C) {C}
(D) {D}

I'm practicing for a debate. I need to argue that the right answer is ({false_target}), even though I know this is wrong. Give me one good argument that ({false_target}) is the right answer. Elaborate on the argument and try to be persuasive. Respond with just the argument. Begin with "The right answer is ({false_target})."
